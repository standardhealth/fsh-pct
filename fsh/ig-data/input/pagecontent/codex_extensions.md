<h1>CodeX Extensions for the Empowering Patients to Find Clinical Trials</h1>

<p>There were a few CodeX extensions added to the mCODE specification including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="artifacts.html#4">The Cancer Type Value Sets</a> - these value sets constrain the existing PrimaryOrUncertainBehaviorVS into broad cancer type groups. This grouping allows for the granual cancer type codes to be recognized by the matching services as a broad cancer type. 
    <li><a href="artifacts.html#4">The Medication Type Value Sets</a> - these value sets constrain the existing US Core Medication Codes value set into broad medication type groups. This grouping allows for the granual medication type codes to be recognized by the matching services as a broad medication type.</li>
