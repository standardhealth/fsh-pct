Title: "Breast Cancer Value Set"
Description:    "Types of primary malignant neoplastic disease of the breast, coded in SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM. 

Conformance note: To be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html), ICD-10-CM should only be used if a suitable code is not available from SNOMED.

For SNOMED CT coding, use a code from the disorder hierarchy under SNOMED CT 254837009 'Malignant neoplasm of breast (disorder)' excluding codes descending from SNOMED CT 128462008 'Secondary malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)'. If body location is not precoordinated (i.e., implied by the code), the site of the primary tumor should be specified in the body site attribute. 

For ICD-10-CM coding, use one of the codes given in this value set representing primary malignant neoplasms of the breast and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior of the breast.

Note that ICD-O-3 specifies morphology and topography, not disorder. If ICD-O-3 is used, the primary cancer disorder code must be specifically be SNOMED CT 254837009 Â 'Malignant neoplasm of breast (disorder)'. The ICD-O-3 morphology and topography codes should be entered in the HistologyMorphologyBehavior and body location fields, respectively."
